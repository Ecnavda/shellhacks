Native Aid is a platform inspired by immigrants, for immigrants. Native Aid was created in order to solve the problem that many immigrants living in the United States who are not fluent in english face when having to fill out government forms that are not available in their language. 

Native Aid allows bilingual speakers who are fluent in english and a second native languge to contribute their knowledge in order to translate forms in parts or in full. 

In the future the platform will also compare different entries for each form under the same language in order to analize fidelity. 

Users who are not fluent in English (r dont speak English at all) will be able to find forms that have been translated to their native language and see translation annotations next to the official English forms so that they can confidently fill in their government forms without needing to rely on people around them to help them complete them.
